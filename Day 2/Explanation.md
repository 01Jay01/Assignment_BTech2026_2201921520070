The NeighborSum class operates on a 10x10 integer grid, providing methods to compute the sum of adjacent and diagonal neighbors of a specified value. It maintains a grid array along with two indices (i, j) to store the position of the target value. The help(int value) method searches for the first occurrence of value in the grid and updates (i, j) accordingly. The adjacentSum(int value) method calculates the sum of horizontally and vertically adjacent elements to the target value. It carefully handles edge cases, ensuring no out-of-bounds errors occur when the value is located on the corners or edges of the grid. Similarly, the diagonalSum(int value) method calculates the sum of diagonal neighbors while checking boundaries to prevent accessing invalid indices. These methods rely on help(value) to locate the target before performing calculations. The class efficiently determines sums while maintaining robustness against boundary conditions, making it useful in grid-based applications such as game development, simulations, and image processing, where neighborhood-based computations are required.
